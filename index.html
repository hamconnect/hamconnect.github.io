<h3>What is a Ham Connect?</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
A Ham Connect is an opportunity for Ham Radio operators to learn how to use their
knowledge to participate more fully in the world of ham radio.  This includes activities
such as contesting, getting on HF, outdoor activities like Parks on the Air (POTA) or Summits
on the AIR (SOTA),
DIY antenna
building, and how to prepare for and
participate in emergency communication (EmComm) either from home or in the
field.  This preparation often involves fun events that provide a community service
while expanding radio skills.
Ham operators will meet other experienced operators from a variety of
local organizations.
